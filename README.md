This project introduces a Smart Attendance System for educational institutions, leveraging Node.js,  
Express Framework, and MongoDB. Node.js provides efficiency and responsiveness, while Express  
facilitates seamless web application development. MongoDB's NoSQL database ensures flexibility and  
scalability in handling attendance data. The system aims to revolutionize traditional attendance  
tracking, offering real-time updates, automated reporting, and user-friendly interfaces, ultimately  
enhancing efficiency and accuracy in student participation monitoring.  
Your team is required to develop the backend solution for a attendance system. A sample of the usecase  
diagram is shown in Figure 1. The job scopes include:  
- [x] Design the database model using MongoDB  
- [x] Secure the database system  
- [ ] Develop the backend server using NodeJs to handle all the relevant RESTful API  
- [ ] Host the application to the Microsoft Azure Cloud
